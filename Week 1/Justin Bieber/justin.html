        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>Justin Drew Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He was discovered at 13 years old by talent manager Scooter Braun after he had watched his YouTube cover song videos. His debut EP, My World, was released in late 2009, making him the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Bieber's success continued with his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, in 2010. Since then, he has become one of the world's best-selling music artists.</p>
